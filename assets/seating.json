  "question": "Six friends A, B, C, D, E, F are sitting in a circle facing the center. A is second to the right of E, who is immediate neighbor of B and C. F is second to the left of D. Who is immediate right of F?",
  "choices": [ "A) A", "B) C", "C) B", "D) D" ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Student Thought: First, I place E. A is 2nd to the right of E, so there is one gap between them (E _ A). E has neighbors B and C. If I put C to the right of E, it takes A's spot or blocks it. So C must be to the left of E, and B must be to the immediate right of E. Now I have the sequence C-E-B-A. Two spots left. F is 2nd to the left of D. This fits if D is next to A and F is next to C. The circle order is C-E-B-A-D-F. The immediate right of F (facing center) is C."

  "question": "8 people sit in two parallel rows. Row 1 (South) has A, B, C, D. Row 2 (North) has P, Q, R, S. A faces S. C is immediate left of A. R is neighbor of P. Person facing Q sits at an extreme end. Who sits between P and R?",
  "choices": [ "A) S", "B) Q", "C) R", "D) P" ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Student Thought: Row 1 faces South (Left is Right). Row 2 faces North. A faces S. C is immediate left of A, so in the South row, it looks like A-C. Since A is not at the edge (C is next to him), and the person facing Q is at an extreme end, Q must be at an end of the North row. R and P are neighbors, meaning they sit side-by-side (e.g., P-R or R-P). If they are immediate neighbors, then *nobody* sits between them. The question asks 'Who sits between P and R?', but the premise states they are neighbors. This implies the answer is 'None', but looking at the options, the intended answer is likely 'Nobody' or the question has a flaw. (Note: In many exams, if forced to choose, 'C' is often a placeholder or typo for 'None/Can't determine', but strictly speaking, the answer is no one)."

  "choices": [ "A) B is between E and D", "B) C is 2nd to the right of B", "C) A is between E and F", "D) F is 2nd to the left of D" ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Student Thought: 'A is in front of S' seems like a typo for E or another name, but let's look at the other clues. C is between A and D. E is 2nd to the right of C. If I place C, then E is two spots counter-clockwise. A is next to C. F is between E and B. If I sketch this: C at bottom, E at right-bottom. A is left of C. D is left of A. B is top right. The circle fills as A-C-D-?-B-E? No, let's use E is 2nd right of C. C(6 o'clock) -> E(2 o'clock). C is between A and D. F is between E and B. This forces the layout: C-A-D-B-F-E. Checking options: A is neighbor to C and D. E is neighbor to F and C? No. The only valid geometric fit that satisfies 'F between E and B' and 'C between A and D' usually places A opposite someone. Looking at choice C: 'A is between E and F'. If the order is E-A-F, that contradicts 'F is between E and B'. Conclusion: This specific question wording contains conflicting constraints."

  "choices": [ "A) Pramod", "B) Rakesh", "C) Rohit", "D) Deepak" ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Student Thought: Let's list the order. Deepak is left of Pramod (Deepak <- Pramod). Anil is between Rakesh and Pramod (Rakesh - Anil - Pramod). So the chain is Rakesh - Anil - Pramod - Deepak. Rohit is between Deepak and Rakesh, which closes the circle (Deepak - Rohit - Rakesh). Full circle: Pramod -> Anil -> Rakesh -> Rohit -> Deepak -> (back to Pramod). Facing center, 'Right' is anti-clockwise. Immediate right of Anil is Rakesh."

  "choices": [ "A) A", "B) C", "C) E", "D) F" ],
  "answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Student Thought: C is sandwiched by A and E. F is 3rd right of E (which means F is opposite E in a 6-person circle). But the prompt says F is opposite B. This is a contradiction (F cannot be opposite both E and B). However, assuming the '3rd right of E' is the stronger clue for positioning: E at bottom, F at top. C is neighbor of E. Let's put C at 5 o'clock, E at 6. A is the other neighbor (7 o'clock)? No, C is between A and E. So A-C-E. F is top. Remaining spots filled by B and D. If F is opposite B, B is at 6 (E's spot). Contradiction confirms the question is flawed. However, usually 'Adjacent to B and D' in these broken puzzles refers to the person sitting between them. If the order is A-C-E-D-B-F, then F is between B and D."

  "choices": [ "A) A", "B) B", "C) C", "D) D" ],

A is immediate right of B (so A is to the left in diagram, but 'right' in South facing means A is at spot 4? No, 'Right' of B is towards the West. Sequence: C _ _ A B? No, B is 4th right of C. C is East-most. B is West-most. C (1) - 2 - 3 - 4 - B(5). A is immediate right of B (West of B?). No, South facing: Right is West. So C is East. B is West. A is Right (West) of B? Then A is off the row. Must be A is left of B visually (Right in South). So C _ _ A B? No. Let's assume standard 'Right' relative to the page for simplicity or strict South. Strict South: C is at extreme Left (East). B is at extreme Right (West). A is immediate Right of B -> Impossible, B is at end. So C must be at Right (West) end? No. Let's try: C at pos 5. Right is pos 1. B is at 1. A is right of B? Off chart. Okay, A is immediate right of B. B is 4th right of C. This implies C is at one end. If C is at Left end (facing South, this is their Right), then B is 4 places to the 'Left' (Page Right). Okay, let's just arrange them linearly. C _ _ _ B. A is next to B. E neighbors A and D.
